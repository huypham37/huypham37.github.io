### The Death Announcement Cycle

I've been hearing about the death of computer science since GPT-3.5 launched. I was among the first in my circle to try it. And every time a new model drops—Claude Opus, GPT-5, Gemini, whatever—the chorus returns: "Computer science is dead."

But here's what these people don't realize: studying computer science was never just about becoming a software engineer.

### The Coffee Shop Moment

Let me tell you something beautiful about studying computer science.

You're out with friends. You walk into a coffee shop, order a drink, and tap your card on the reader. For most people, that's the end of the transaction. But for you, time stops for a second.

In that moment, you understand everything. You see where the money goes. You understand the transaction flow, the processing systems behind it, the encryption schemes protecting that tap. The entire invisible architecture reveals itself to you.

That feeling? That's the real reward of studying computer science. And no AI model can take that away from you.

### It's Not Just About Code

This isn't unique to computer science. A mechanical engineer looks at a car engine and sees the symphony of combustion, torque, and thermal dynamics that everyone else ignores. They look at a drill, a boat, a machine—and they know what's happening inside.

That's the beautiful thing about studying any discipline deeply. It's not just about career prospects—though yes, careers matter. It's about developing eyes that see what others can't.

### The Point

Ten years from now, a hundred years from now, the value of understanding systems will remain. AI might write code faster than us. But the excitement of comprehending how things work—that's yours forever.

Computer science isn't dead. The people declaring its death just never understood what it was really about.
