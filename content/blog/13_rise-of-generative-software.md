## A perspective on the evolving landscape of software development

### The Question Everyone's Asking

A few years ago, a colleague asked me: "What does the future look like if you're a software engineer?" My answer then remains my answer now: AI will not replace software engineers, but it will fundamentally change what we do.

We're entering an era of more adaptive, personal software than we've ever seen before. Today's coding agents can generate entire applications from a single prompt. But here's what most people miss: the hardest problems in software engineering were never about writing the code itself.

### The Problems AI Doesn't Solve

#### Security

You cannot simply prompt GPT to design "the most secure software" because perfectly secure software doesn't exist. Security is an ongoing discipline, not a feature you bolt on. More critically: if you lack the knowledge to validate whether AI-generated code is secure, you're building on a foundation you don't understand. This is a massive blind spot in the "anyone can code now" narrative.

#### Scalability

For the past decade, the central challenge in software engineering hasn't been writing code—it's been scaling it. Without deep knowledge of data structures, system architecture, and maintainability patterns, you cannot prompt an LLM to produce genuinely scalable software. And even if you could, you wouldn't have the expertise to validate or test the result.

#### Optimization

AI-generated software often works, but it can be bloated—consuming excessive RAM, disk space, and processing power. Optimization requires understanding not just what code does, but how it does it at the system level. This is precisely where AI-generated code falls short, and where human expertise remains essential.

### A New Category: Generative Software

Here's where things get interesting. We need to rethink how we categorize software.

Traditionally, software fell into two camps: commercial and open-source. But now there's a third category emerging—what I call **generative software**: applications created by individuals using AI to solve their specific needs.

Let me give you a concrete example. I use DataSpell, JetBrains' IDE for data work. But I only use it for Jupyter notebooks with Python. I don't need 90% of its features, yet it consumes a massive chunk of my RAM. What I actually want is a lean, stripped-down version that does exactly what I need—nothing more.

This is the promise of generative software: personal, adaptive applications tailored to individual use cases. Not the bloated one-size-fits-all products we've been stuck with, but lightweight tools that do exactly what you need.

### From Binary to Nuanced

The software world is becoming more nuanced than the binary choices we had before. It's no longer "this product or that product." People have different opinions on which features matter. Some want feature X but not Y; others want the opposite.

Generative software enables this personalization. You can have software with exactly the features you need—adapted to your workflow, your preferences, your constraints.

### The Bottom Line

Will AI replace software engineers? No.

AI doesn't solve security. It doesn't solve scalability. It doesn't solve optimization. These remain fundamentally human problems requiring human expertise.

But AI will democratize software creation for personal use. If you don't care about enterprise-grade security, if you don't need to scale to millions of users, if you're okay with somewhat inefficient code—then yes, you can now create the software you want.

The future isn't AI versus engineers. It's AI-assisted individuals creating personal tools while engineers continue solving the hard problems that AI cannot. We need to look at software engineering from a different angle than we did before—the landscape has changed, but the need for deep expertise hasn't gone away.

Welcome to the age of generative software.
