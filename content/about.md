## I’m Steve. 

I’m a 2nd-year CS student at Maastricht University, where I write code that doesn’t suck and bend AI to my will for personal knowledge management (PKM) and productivity hacks. Before this, I wasted three years in precision mechanics—turns out, wrenches are just primitive debuggers. I can talk several hours about new, emerging trends in AI world, or new paper, techniques around machine learning. 

Also I love writing about what I am thinking (mostly can be severely diverse in topic, sorry). Now my thinking is 100% stucked with AI and deeplearning, you might find most of my writing here related to that. 

### Stack Trace

I’ve got a degree in Automation and Robotics from Centennial College, where I wrestled PLCs, SCADA systems, and industrial robots into submission. It was fine, if you like legacy hardware and zero abstraction layers. Now I’m at Maastricht, upgrading my kernel to CS and leaving the meatspace tinkering behind.

### Running Processes

When I’m not optimizing uni’s subpar assignments, I’m building CLI tools—because real devs type, and GUIs are for peasants who can’t handle a terminal. I engineer PKM systems for maximum signal-to-noise and train AI to do the heavy lifting so I don’t have to. Mediocrity’s a memory leak—I’m here to garbage-collect it. 

### SSH Access

If you’ve got something, hit me on [GitHub](https://github.com/huypham37?tab=overview&from=2025-02-01&to=2025-02-27). I might respond, unless your idea’s a 404 or you’re pushing untested commits. Fair warning: I don’t suffer fools, bad code, or mouse-clickers.
