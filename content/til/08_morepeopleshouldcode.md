I came across this post this morning, and Andrew Ng’s thoughts about the future of AI resonated with my own thoughts about the future of coding.

“As coding becomes easier, more people should code, not fewer!”

- [Andrew Ng](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-292/)

Let’s consider the launch of GPT-3.5 by OpenAI in 2020. Could we ask it to brainstorm 32 ideas that will make AI useful in the next five years? We couldn’t, and even now, we can’t.

In 2025, five years after GPT-3.5, we have more useful tools built from AI, such as DeepSearch and AI-Agent. These tools are the result of human hands and brains, not AI ideas.

AI excels at repetitive tasks like searching, synthesizing information, and more searching. However, it lacks the ability to come up with new ideas that will potentially change the world.
