Today I learned about the key differences between pipelining and concurrency:

## Pipelining

- **Low-level Hardware Technique:** Breaks down instruction execution into stages like fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back.
- **Assembly Line Approach:** Multiple instructions are processed simultaneously with each in a different stage, enabling a new instruction per clock cycle.
- **Improved Throughput:** Enhances processing without the need to increase the clock speed.

## Concurrency

- **Higher-level Concept:** Deals with multiple computations happening during overlapping time periods.
- **Various Models:** Implemented via multithreading, multiprocessing, or asynchronous programming.
- **Design Focus:** Emphasizes logical task parallelism and efficient program design rather than instruction-level execution.

## Key Distinction

- **Pipelining:** Implemented in the CPU hardware, focusing on instruction-level parallelism.
- **Concurrency:** Managed by software and operating systems to run multiple tasks simultaneously.

Understanding these concepts helps align hardware execution with software design for more efficient systems.

Happy Learning!
