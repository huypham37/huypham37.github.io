XOR (exclusive OR) is a fundamental bitwise operation that returns true only when inputs differ. While it seems simple, XOR has powerful applications beyond basic logic gates that every programmer should know.

- **Toggling Bits:** XOR provides an elegant way to flip specific bits without affecting others.
  
Let x = 9 (binary 1001) Toggle the 3rd bit with x ^ 0x04 (0x04 = 0100) 1001 ^ 0100 = 1101 = 13 (3rd bit flips from 0 to 1)

- **Swapping Values:** XOR enables swapping two variables without using a temporary variable.

Let a = 5 (0101), b = 3 (0011) a ^= b: 0101 ^ 0011 = 0110 (a = 6) b ^= a: 0011 ^ 0110 = 0101 (b = 5) a ^= b: 0110 ^ 0101 = 0011 (a = 3) Result: a = 3, b = 5 (swapped!)

- **Finding Unique Number:** XOR can find a single non-repeated element in an array where all other elements appear exactly twice.
Array: [3, 5, 3, 4, 4] XOR all: 3 ^ 5 ^ 3 ^ 4 ^ 4 3 ^ 3 = 0 (pairs cancel), 4 ^ 4 = 0, leaving 5 Result: 5 (the number appearing once)

The magic of XOR lies in its key properties: it's commutative (order doesn't matter), associative (grouping doesn't matter), self-inverse (a number XORed with itself gives 0), and identity element (any number XORed with 0 is itself). These properties make XOR particularly useful in cryptography, memory-efficient algorithms, and embedded systems programming.
