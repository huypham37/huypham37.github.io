"AI will write 90% of the code for software engineers within the next three to six months and every line of code within the next year."-Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei 

I would think the same with bullsh** internet contents in the three to six months. 

That is why I love writing.

Even my writing sucks, grammars, vocabularies....

But who cares, when I dies, this writing is actuall from me, with horrible grammar errors, with terrible vocabs that can bore anyone from the first word. But it is mine, 
not from the freaking robot (AGI, huh?). 

I believe, my content, and my idea, my thought or anyone's manual writing (sh**, now I have to use "manual" for writing), thought would be a treasure in this digital realm. 

That's why I write, and will write.
