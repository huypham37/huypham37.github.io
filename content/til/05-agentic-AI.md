# The Difference Between Non-Agentic AI vs Agentic AI

The hype of generative AI is gone; people now are more familiar with what a generative AI can do. But I think there is a lot more an AI (or specifically a LLM) can do, more than just "Write me an essay in 4000 words like a first year college student."

- **Non-agentic AI:** This is basically a generative AI which you give it an input, give you an output, no recheck, no question, no feedback. It's like a robot that you give it a command, it does it, and that's it.

- **Agentic AI:** A generative AI with a set of tools. The newest application of agentic AI is deep research or deep search from multiple frontier AI companies like OpenAI, Deepseek or Google - AI which can talk to an API, send requests to websites, surf the web, re-check the value and produce a result. The typical agentic AI workflow would look like this:
