<h3 id="the-question-everyones-asking">The Question Everyone&rsquo;s Asking</h3>
<p>A few years ago, a colleague asked me: &ldquo;What does the future look like if you&rsquo;re a software engineer?&rdquo; My answer then remains my answer now: AI will not replace software engineers, but it will fundamentally change what we do.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re entering an era of more adaptive, personal software than we&rsquo;ve ever seen before. Today&rsquo;s coding agents can generate entire applications from a single prompt. But here&rsquo;s what most people miss: the hardest problems in software engineering were never about writing the code itself.</p>
<h3 id="the-problems-ai-doesnt-solve">The Problems AI Doesn&rsquo;t Solve</h3>
<h4 id="security">Security</h4>
<p>You cannot simply prompt GPT to design &ldquo;the most secure software&rdquo; because perfectly secure software doesn&rsquo;t exist. Security is an ongoing discipline, not a feature you bolt on. More critically: if you lack the knowledge to validate whether AI-generated code is secure, you&rsquo;re building on a foundation you don&rsquo;t understand. This is a massive blind spot in the &ldquo;anyone can code now&rdquo; narrative.</p>
<h4 id="scalability">Scalability</h4>
<p>For the past decade, the central challenge in software engineering hasn&rsquo;t been writing code—it&rsquo;s been scaling it. Without deep knowledge of data structures, system architecture, and maintainability patterns, you cannot prompt an LLM to produce genuinely scalable software. And even if you could, you wouldn&rsquo;t have the expertise to validate or test the result.</p>
<h4 id="optimization">Optimization</h4>
<p>AI-generated software often works, but it can be bloated—consuming excessive RAM, disk space, and processing power. Optimization requires understanding not just what code does, but how it does it at the system level. This is precisely where AI-generated code falls short, and where human expertise remains essential.</p>
<h3 id="a-new-category-generative-software">A New Category: Generative Software</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where things get interesting. We need to rethink how we categorize software.</p>
<p>Traditionally, software fell into two camps: commercial and open-source. But now there&rsquo;s a third category emerging—what I call <strong>generative software</strong>: applications created by individuals using AI to solve their specific needs.</p>
<p>Let me give you a concrete example. I use DataSpell, JetBrains&rsquo; IDE for data work. But I only use it for Jupyter notebooks with Python. I don&rsquo;t need 90% of its features, yet it consumes a massive chunk of my RAM. What I actually want is a lean, stripped-down version that does exactly what I need—nothing more.</p>
<p>This is the promise of generative software: personal, adaptive applications tailored to individual use cases. Not the bloated one-size-fits-all products we&rsquo;ve been stuck with, but lightweight tools that do exactly what you need.</p>
<h3 id="from-binary-to-nuanced">From Binary to Nuanced</h3>
<p>The software world is becoming more nuanced than the binary choices we had before. It&rsquo;s no longer &ldquo;this product or that product.&rdquo; People have different opinions on which features matter. Some want feature X but not Y; others want the opposite.</p>
<p>Generative software enables this personalization. You can have software with exactly the features you need—adapted to your workflow, your preferences, your constraints.</p>
<h3 id="the-bottom-line">The Bottom Line</h3>
<p>Will AI replace software engineers? No.</p>
<p>AI doesn&rsquo;t solve security. It doesn&rsquo;t solve scalability. It doesn&rsquo;t solve optimization. These remain fundamentally human problems requiring human expertise.</p>
<p>But AI will democratize software creation for personal use. If you don&rsquo;t care about enterprise-grade security, if you don&rsquo;t need to scale to millions of users, if you&rsquo;re okay with somewhat inefficient code—then yes, you can now create the software you want.</p>
<p>The future isn&rsquo;t AI versus engineers. It&rsquo;s AI-assisted individuals creating personal tools while engineers continue solving the hard problems that AI cannot. We need to look at software engineering from a different angle than we did before—the landscape has changed, but the need for deep expertise hasn&rsquo;t gone away.</p>
<p>Welcome to the age of generative software.</p>

                            <div class="til-content"><p>I went through this nice quote that truly align with what I thought for a very long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a new programmer, my optimistic version is that there has never been a better time to learn to program, because it shaves down the learning curve so much. When you&rsquo;re learning to program and you miss a semicolon and you bang your head against the computer for four hours [&hellip;] if you&rsquo;re unlucky you quit programming for good because it was so frustrating. [&hellip;]</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a project-oriented learner; I can learn things by building something, and now the friction involved in building something has gone down so much [&hellip;] So I think especially if you&rsquo;re an autodidact, if you&rsquo;re somebody who likes teaching yourself things, these are a gift from heaven. You get a weird teaching assistant that knows loads of stuff and occasionally makes weird mistakes and believes in bizarre conspiracy theories, but you have 24 hour access to that assistant.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody who prefers structured learning in classrooms, I think the benefits are going to take a lot longer to get to you because we don&rsquo;t know how to use these things in classrooms yet. [&hellip;]</p>
<p>If you want to strike out on your own, this is an amazing tool if you learn how to learn with it. So you&rsquo;ve got to learn the limits of what it can do, and you&rsquo;ve got to be disciplined enough to make sure you&rsquo;re not outsourcing the bits you need to learn to the machines.&rdquo; - Simon Willison.</p>
<p>Well, more people should code now, because it is never a better time.</p>

<p>I would think the same with bullsh** internet contents in the three to six months.</p>
<p>That is why I love writing.</p>
<p>Even my writing sucks, grammars, vocabularies&hellip;.</p>
<p>But who cares, when I dies, this writing is actuall from me, with horrible grammar errors, with terrible vocabs that can bore anyone from the first word. But it is mine,
not from the freaking robot (AGI, huh?).</p>
<p>I believe, my content, and my idea, my thought or anyone&rsquo;s manual writing (sh**, now I have to use &ldquo;manual&rdquo; for writing), thought would be a treasure in this digital realm.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I write, and will write.</p>

<p>Let’s consider the launch of GPT-3.5 by OpenAI in 2020. Could we ask it to brainstorm 32 ideas that will make AI useful in the next five years? We couldn’t, and even now, we can’t.</p>
<p>In 2025, five years after GPT-3.5, we have more useful tools built from AI, such as DeepSearch and AI-Agent. These tools are the result of human hands and brains, not AI ideas.</p>
<p>AI excels at repetitive tasks like searching, synthesizing information, and more searching. However, it lacks the ability to come up with new ideas that will potentially change the world.</p>

<p>Normal people workflows with LLMs are like this, and think they can learn from them:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a problem X</li>
<li>I ask LLM to solve it</li>
<li>LLM gives me a solution</li>
<li>I take the solution and run it</li>
<li>It works, I am happy</li>
<li>Then I ask LLM to explain the solution -&gt; I learned it.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine, but in the best case.</p>
<p>Then how I work with LLMs:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a problem X</li>
<li>I ask LLM to solve it</li>
<li>LLM gives me a solution</li>
<li>This goddamn solution is hallucinated, the apis was from the sky (but sometimes I found they come up better name than the code owners)</li>
<li>I go read the documents, read the code of the LLMs.</li>
<li>Fix it, it works, I am happy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of passively ask LLM to explain the solution, I actually just solve the problem by myself just by stepping backward and looking at the problem.</p>

<li>
<p>Copilot is not a magical tool; it can&rsquo;t create wonders on its own. It&rsquo;s best to ask it to assist with repetitive tasks or generate boilerplate code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fall into the trap of relying solely on Copilot. Read the error messages from the terminal or test output. I used to spend two hours repeatedly passing terminal failed error messages to Copilot, asking it to fix them, but it couldn&rsquo;t. The loop would continue until I read the error message and fixed it myself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, Copilot can be helpful in a way. It can prevent you from writing overly complex code by suggesting that &ldquo;Just do it.&rdquo; By removing the initial barrier of syntax and structure, you can start writing code without overthinking it.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Numerical Integration for π:</strong><br>
The function computes π by integrating the function <code>4/(1+x^2)</code> over [0,1] using a Riemann sum with midpoints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Timing with std::chrono:</strong><br>
The duration for the computation is measured using C++11&rsquo;s <code>&lt;chrono&gt;</code> utilities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-openmp">Using OpenMP</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Parallel Region:</strong><br>
The computation is performed inside an OpenMP parallel region where each thread calculates a partial sum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Local Sum per Thread:</strong><br>
Each thread uses its own <code>local_sum</code> variable to accumulate values from its portion of the loop. This prevents race conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Combining Results:</strong><br>
There are two common ways to combine the thread-local results:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Critical Section:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Wrap the update of <code>sum</code> in a <code>#pragma omp critical</code> block.</li>
<li>This ensures only one thread updates <code>sum</code> at a time.</li>
<li><strong>Downside:</strong> Overhead due to thread contention.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Reduction Clause:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>#pragma omp for reduction(+:sum)</code> which provides each thread with a private copy of <code>sum</code>.</li>
<li>OpenMP automatically handles the combination after the loop.</li>
<li><strong>Advantage:</strong> More efficient with less overhead compared to a critical section.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-we-observed">What We Observed</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong><br>
Removing the critical section can show faster performance since threads don&rsquo;t have to wait. However, without any mechanism (like reduction) to combine the results, the final value of <code>sum</code> would be computed incorrectly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Correctness vs. Overhead:</strong><br>
The critical directive ensures correctness by serializing the merging of results, but at the cost of performance. The reduction clause offers both correctness and better performance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The critical directive allows only one thread to execute a block at a time, ensuring safe updates to shared variables but can slow down the program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reduction clause creates private copies of a variable for each thread, automatically merging them after execution, which minimizes synchronization overhead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This summary encapsulates the key insights related to parallel computation and synchronization using OpenMP as discussed in the context of the <code>compute_pi.cpp</code> file.</p>

<pre tabindex="0"><code>Hello Hello from thread from thread 12

</code></pre><h2 id="the-solution-using-stringstream">The Solution: Using stringstream</h2>
<p>A better approach is to use <code>std::stringstream</code> to build the complete string in thread-local storage before writing to <code>std::cout</code>:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="why-this-works">Why This Works</h2>
<ol>
<li><code>std::stringstream</code> creates a thread-local buffer for building the output string</li>
<li>The string construction happens entirely within each thread</li>
<li>The final write to <code>std::cout</code> is more likely to be atomic when writing a single string</li>
<li>Each thread maintains its own independent stringstream, preventing race conditions</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="alternative-using-critical-sections">Alternative: Using Critical Sections</h2>
<p>If you really need to use <code>std::cout</code> directly, you can also use OpenMP&rsquo;s critical section:</p>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>However, using <code>stringstream</code> is often more efficient as it minimizes the time spent in critical sections.</p>
<h2 id="key-takeaway">Key Takeaway</h2>
<p>When dealing with multithreaded output in C++, always remember that <code>std::cout</code> operations are not thread-safe. Use <code>std::stringstream</code> to build output strings locally before writing them, or properly synchronize access to <code>std::cout</code> using critical sections or mutexes.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Why this works</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>LLVM&rsquo;s version of Clang includes OpenMP support</li>
<li>Setting compiler paths before <code>project()</code> ensures CMake uses the correct compiler</li>
<li>Environment variables ensure system-wide availability of LLVM tools</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Key Commands</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cmake ..</code> - Generates build system using parent directory&rsquo;s CMakeLists.txt</li>
<li><code>cmake --build .</code> - Compiles the code using generated build system</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Environment Variables Purpose</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>PATH</code>: Makes LLVM binaries available system-wide</li>
<li><code>CC/CXX</code>: Sets default C/C++ compilers</li>
<li><code>LDFLAGS/CPPFLAGS</code>: Provides linker and preprocessor with LLVM library locations</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
