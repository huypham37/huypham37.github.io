                        <div class="til-content"><p>I went through this nice quote that truly align with what I thought for a very long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a new programmer, my optimistic version is that there has never been a better time to learn to program, because it shaves down the learning curve so much. When you&rsquo;re learning to program and you miss a semicolon and you bang your head against the computer for four hours [&hellip;] if you&rsquo;re unlucky you quit programming for good because it was so frustrating. [&hellip;]</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a project-oriented learner; I can learn things by building something, and now the friction involved in building something has gone down so much [&hellip;] So I think especially if you&rsquo;re an autodidact, if you&rsquo;re somebody who likes teaching yourself things, these are a gift from heaven. You get a weird teaching assistant that knows loads of stuff and occasionally makes weird mistakes and believes in bizarre conspiracy theories, but you have 24 hour access to that assistant.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody who prefers structured learning in classrooms, I think the benefits are going to take a lot longer to get to you because we don&rsquo;t know how to use these things in classrooms yet. [&hellip;]</p>
<p>If you want to strike out on your own, this is an amazing tool if you learn how to learn with it. So you&rsquo;ve got to learn the limits of what it can do, and you&rsquo;ve got to be disciplined enough to make sure you&rsquo;re not outsourcing the bits you need to learn to the machines.&rdquo; - Simon Willison.</p>
<p>Well, more people should code now, because it is never a better time.</p>
